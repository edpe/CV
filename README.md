##Ed Perkins



##Who am I?

I recently graduated as a doctor of music, which is perhaps more relevant than it may initially seem. I have spent my career using technology to facilitate and support interactions between groups of people both on stage and in education, I've even written an entire 45,000 word [PhD thesis](http://edperkins.co.uk/LEEP.pdf) about it. 

I've not only written about it, I have performed, formed ensembles, organised events and tours, built [electronic instruments](https://youtu.be/k81meVMH7uk), and exhibited sound art installations across the UK and Europe at venues including [Ars Electronica(Linsz)](https://youtu.be/9vhrE7nrzNY), [SARC(Belfast)](https://youtu.be/k81meVMH7uk), the ICA(London) and the Tate Modern. I am keen to share what I do and besides [blogging and sharing my project diaries](http://edperkins.tumblr.com/), I have talked about and presented my work at universities and conferences across the UK, at Dorkbot meetings and Maker Faires, and also on BBC TV & Radio, Resonance FM, and The Discovery Channel(Canada). I also feature as part of the [British Music Collection](https://britishmusiccollection.org.uk/composer/ed-perkins).


For the last twelve years my work has focussed on building software and electronic devices that either model or support human interaction. I designed and built the multiplayer electronic instrument [Conductable](https://youtu.be/s4AuEc8rVq0) for the Aldburgh festival in 2013 as part of a team of engineers, musicians and model design undergraduates. I also designed and programmed [The Stream](https://youtu.be/4APoBti_s44), a generative composition system that modelled a virtual society and converted the data streams to musical score. The work was performed on numerous occaisions as part of a residency with the RPS award winning contemporary music ensemble [Apartment House](http://www.apartmenthouse.co.uk/).

I would like to work with technology that facilitates communication ans shared experience, where technology enriches rather than obscures human interaction. I love being in creative environments and working with inspiring people to develop unique and innovative solutions. I am always learning and most of my life has been spent in education as both student and educator. My enthusiasm and commitment to self development, challenging myself and embracing new technology is evident in my academic and artistic work.


##Things I am good at

###Developing Technology
I have been developing one particular electronic instrument for over ten years, using each performance and rehearsal as an opportunity for testing, failing and feedback. Chimera is an instrument that uses a range of acoustic instruments as sound sources and models the subtlety of physical control achievable through the tactility and resistance of acoustic instruments. Chimera currently implements a combination of MaxMSP(granular synthesis), MYO EEG wristbands, XBee radio, pressure sensors and accelerometers. I have used the instrument primarily in ensemble work, and it has the ability to send information to other electronic instruments during a performance using OSC. I am currently implementing a machine learning library to recognise certain ways of holding the instrument in order to trigger corresponding sonic behaviour. You can see me playing it in the ensemble From Honey To Ashes [here](https://youtu.be/k81meVMH7uk). Within the ensemble we worked as a group to develop a central server that generated LFO patterns for synchronisation that in turn could be affected by us and sent back to the server for further distribution. We used a combination of MaxMSP and Supercollider for the software which sent OSC data over a wireless local network.

###Coaching/Learning
Whilst lecturing in Electroacoustic Composition and Live Electronics Performance at UEA, I was awarded the Teaching Fellowship Award. This award enabled me, as a postgraduate student, to spend time sharing my research and methods with undergraduate students to enhance their learning. I also developed an online blog which allowed students to have access to the code and slides from each week's lecture and facilitated peer learning through a comments section.

As a dissertation supervisor, I supported project development and advised on technical solutions to concepts including a backgammon board that provided a musical soundtrack to the game and an electronic instrument played by the manipulation of conductive rubber. Through supporting the undergraduates I had to quickly learn a range of new technology including arduino, electronics and analogue video processing which I also applied to my own practice.

###Introducing new technology

I Introduced and trained staff in google docs at Access to Music Norwich in 2008. This massively increased data accuracy and communication whilst saving physical resources, office space and tightening up on safeguarding. The following year Google docs and apps began to be adopted by the company as a whole. Later on in the same role I intoduced the use of NAS drives for storing audio and video coursework which could also be accessed remotely for invigilation.

In my role as National Events co-ordinator I adopted Eventbrite as a company standard for managing event ticketing and invitations. This included a live trial for the National Music Student Awards. I also designed and managed an online submission system using soundcloud and web forms for unsigned bands to win the chance to go on a tour of venues across the UK.

###Working under presure 
Before studying at Makers Academy I was working full time as the only IT, Estates and Resources member of staff at a busy media college, writing up my PhD, buying and selling a house, being executor to my parent's estate, playing in two bands and being a dad to a baby and a preschooler. I'm used to prioritising my workload and understanding how to manage multiple projects at once. I am also able to manage stressful environments and keep a cool head to make sure that the work gets done, wether that means pulling an all nighter,   coming up with new approaches quickly or just motivating and encouraging the rest of my team.

##Interests

I am currently playing in an ambient doom jazz band, playing jazz standards at 1/8th speed and filling the gaps with huge reverb tails, ambient field recordings and the undulating hum of valve electronics.  I also enjoy slow roasting meat and cooking with smoked paprika. Other than that I am a dad to two girls who occasionally enjoys escaping to the world of Skyrim/GTA V/No Manâ€™s Sky.
