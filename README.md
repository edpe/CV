## Ed Perkins



## Who am I?

I recently graduated as a doctor of music, which is perhaps more relevant than it may initially seem. I have spent my career using technology to facilitate and support interactions between groups of people both on stage and in education, I've even written an entire 45,000 word [PhD thesis](http://edperkins.co.uk/LEEP.pdf) about it. 

I've not only written about it, I have performed, formed ensembles, organised events and tours, built [electronic instruments](https://youtu.be/k81meVMH7uk), and exhibited sound art installations across the UK and Europe at venues including [Ars Electronica(Linsz)](https://youtu.be/9vhrE7nrzNY), [SARC(Belfast)](https://youtu.be/k81meVMH7uk), the ICA(London) and the Tate Modern. I am keen to share what I do and besides [blogging and sharing my project diaries](http://edperkins.tumblr.com/), I have talked about and presented my work at universities and conferences across the UK, at Dorkbot meetings and Maker Faires, and also on BBC TV & Radio, Resonance FM, and The Discovery Channel(Canada). I also feature as part of the [British Music Collection](https://britishmusiccollection.org.uk/composer/ed-perkins).


For the last twelve years my work has focussed on building software and electronic devices that either model or support human interaction. I designed and built the multiplayer electronic instrument [Conductable](https://youtu.be/s4AuEc8rVq0) for the Aldburgh festival in 2013 as part of a team of engineers, musicians and model design undergraduates. I also designed and programmed [The Stream](https://youtu.be/4APoBti_s44), a generative composition system that modelled a virtual society and converted the data streams to musical score. The work was performed on numerous occaisions as part of a residency with the RPS award winning contemporary music ensemble [Apartment House](http://www.apartmenthouse.co.uk/).

I would like to work with technology that facilitates communication and shared experience, where technology enriches rather than obscures human interaction. I love being in creative environments and working with inspiring people to develop unique and innovative solutions. I am always learning and most of my life has been spent in education as both student and educator. My enthusiasm and commitment to self development, challenging myself and embracing new technology is evident in my academic and artistic work.

### Developing Technology
I have been developing one particular electronic instrument for over ten years, using each performance and rehearsal as an opportunity for testing, failing and feedback. Chimera is an instrument that uses a range of acoustic instruments as sound sources and models the subtlety of physical control achievable through the tactility and resistance of acoustic instruments. Chimera currently implements a combination of MaxMSP(granular synthesis), MYO EEG wristbands, XBee radio, pressure sensors and accelerometers. I have used the instrument primarily in ensemble work, and it has the ability to send information to other electronic instruments during a performance using OSC. I am currently implementing a machine learning library to recognise certain ways of holding the instrument in order to trigger corresponding sonic behaviour. You can see me playing it in the ensemble From Honey To Ashes [here](https://youtu.be/k81meVMH7uk). Within the ensemble we worked as a group to develop a central server that generated LFO patterns for synchronisation that in turn could be affected by us and sent back to the server for further distribution. We used a combination of MaxMSP and Supercollider for the software which sent OSC data over a wireless local network.

## Interests

I am currently playing in an ambient doom jazz band, playing jazz standards at 1/8th speed and filling the gaps with huge reverb tails, ambient field recordings and the undulating hum of valve electronics.  I also enjoy slow roasting meat and cooking with smoked paprika. Other than that I am a dad to two girls who occasionally enjoys escaping to the world of Skyrim, GTA V or No Manâ€™s Sky.
