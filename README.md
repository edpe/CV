### Who am I? <a name= "whoami"></a>

I'm fairly new to the world of web development, but no stranger to technology and have been coding and using electronics since I was ten. I recently graduated as a doctor of music and have spent my career developing new technology to facilitate interactions between groups of people both on stage and in education, I've even written 45,000 words of [PhD thesis](http://edperkins.co.uk/LEEP.pdf) about it. 

I recently graduated from Europe's leading Web Developer bootcamp [Maker's Academy](https://www.makersacademy.com/) and am looking to work somewhere that is a good cultural fit for me. I would like to work somewhere where agile development, XP values and TDD go hand in hand with ongoing personal development, good communication, emotional intelligence and the freedom to be creative and learn new things. 

### What do I do? <a name= "what"></a>
For the last twelve years my work has focussed on building software and electronic devices that either model or support human interaction:

* I developed camera tracking software with audio feedback for a research project which used entrainment to rhythm to rehabilitate the upper limb movement of stroke patients in collaboration with researchers at Goldsmiths and UEA. 

* I designed and built the multiplayer electronic instrument [Conductable](https://youtu.be/s4AuEc8rVq0) for the Aldburgh festival in 2013 as part of a team of engineers, musicians and model design undergraduates. 

* I designed, programmed and project managed [The Stream](https://youtu.be/4APoBti_s44), a generative composition system that modelled a virtual society and converted the data streams to musical score. The work was performed on numerous occaisions as part of a residency with the RPS award winning contemporary music ensemble [Apartment House](http://www.apartmenthouse.co.uk/).

I have also performed, formed ensembles, organised events and tours, built [electronic instruments](https://youtu.be/k81meVMH7uk), and exhibited sound art installations across the UK and Europe at venues including [Ars Electronica(Linsz)](https://youtu.be/9vhrE7nrzNY), [SARC(Belfast)](https://youtu.be/k81meVMH7uk), the ICA(London) and the Tate Modern. I am keen to share what I do and besides [blogging and sharing my project diaries](http://edperkins.tumblr.com/), I have talked about and presented my work at universities and conferences across the UK, at Dorkbot meetings and Maker Faires, and also on BBC TV & Radio, Resonance FM, and The Discovery Channel(Canada). I also feature as part of the [British Music Collection](https://britishmusiccollection.org.uk/composer/ed-perkins). Most recently I worked as part of a team to develop [dawn](https://rcvink.github.io/dawn/), a simple genetic simulator/eye candy built in JavaScript using the Matter P5 libraries with testing in Jasmine.

### Projects <a name= "projects"></a>
I recently completed the Makers Academy coding bootcamp and learnt lots of new things very intensely in a very short space of time including Ruby, Rails, Javascript, TDD, HTML and many other things that seem too numerous given the fact that they only occured over four months. I implemented them on the following projects:

| Project | Description| Tech stack | Testing | Team type|
|-----|--------|--------|---|---|
| [dawn](https://github.com/jenniferemshepherd/dawn)    | This is a procedurally generated sociogenetic simulation with it's own [blog](https://medium.com/@dawnmakersacademy) if you want to find out more. Dawn is a zero player game/artwork using physics, animation and sound | JavaScript, Matter.js, P5.js, eslint | Jasmine | Group | 
| [jennifer.js](https://github.com/ealitten/jennifer.js)  | Everyone loves testing, so why not build your own Javascript testing framework? But how to test the testing framework? Hmmm  | JavaScript | jennifer.js | Group |
|[v a p o r b n b](https://github.com/edpe/vapor-bnb)| A vaporwave themed AirBnB clone with added aesthetic |Ruby, DataMapper, PostgreSQL, Sinatra, CSS, Bootstrap, HTML, Rubocop| Capybara, Rspec | Group |
| [Gilded Rose](https://github.com/edpe/gilded-rose-ruby/tree/master/lib) | This is a tech test I completed over a day and a half in Ruby, I was particularly happy with my sneaky use of class inheritance in order to sidestep the rule against updating the item class ;) | Ruby | Rspec| Solo |
